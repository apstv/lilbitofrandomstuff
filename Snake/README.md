Snake is a game I made with Tech With Tim tutorial. Original code is available here: https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/game-development-with-python/snake-pygame/tutorial-4/

Snake can go through walls, but game ends when it bites itself. Snake also dies when you try to go in the opposite direction,
for example - snake is going left and you press right arrow key. I changed some colors to make game look more soft.
I added a score shown in the messagebox at the end, not only in terminal. After defeat player can decide to play again or leave.
If player presses 'yes' button game is starting again. If player chooses 'no', programme turns off.
