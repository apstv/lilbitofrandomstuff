Alien Invasion is a game I made with Python Crash Course. All of the original resources are available here: https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/tree/master/chapter_14

In my game you are playing with a spaceturtle trying to destroy evil octopuses.
You have 3 lives to destroy all of them.

Things to fix/improve:
- showing remaining lives in the upper left corner
- best score ever (prepare an external file keeping best score and then showing it in game)
- escaping aliens - game doesn't respond to aliens touching bottom of the screen
- add more levels (and increase difficulty)
